                <p>I was born 15.09.2001 in Riga. When I was 6 I started to participate in the theater. Thanks to that I had an opportunities to perform on the stage in front of auditory and meet new friends. We have been travelled a lot and took part in different festivals and competitions.
                <p>During our trips I started to be passionate about photography <a href="pictures.html" title="pictures">(check my works here)</a>. I enjoy to take portraits of my friends and capture the beautiful landscapes.</p>
                <p>I took the drawing courses to gain base knowledge about art and drawing. I like to snowboard and visit my family.</p>
